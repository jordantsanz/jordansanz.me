        Hello! Welcome to my page.

        My name is Jordan Sanz, and I'm a Dartmouth '22 studying computer science and quantitative social science.
        <img src="/Pictures/snow_pic.jpg" alt="Snow Picture" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
        This is me in the snow! I love the snow more than almost anything.
        Thanks for visiting my page; hopefully, there's more here next time!

        All the best, 
        Jordan
